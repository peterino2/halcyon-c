# overview of the story
# stories are organized into regions
# entire games are consisted of a list of regions
eg. 


# once a region is created in halcyon. it is marked by a region.halc
# entire games could just be one region depending on the size of 
# the game and the region.

# within a region there are categories
# regions are intended to be modular and dependencies across regions 
# must be queried and optional.

# within a region though, it is expected that all content needed to 
# execute each story graph is properly loaded when the region is loaded
